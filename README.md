## Technologies Used

Quikkdesign is built with a number of modern web technologies, each of which plays an important role in making the editor fast, responsive, and user-friendly.

### React

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Quikkdesign is built with React because it makes it easy to create reusable components, manage state, and render changes to the DOM efficiently. React's Virtual DOM also helps ensure that Quikkdesign runs smoothly and without lag.

### Tailwind

Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to style components quickly and consistently. Quikkdesign is built with Tailwind because it provides a robust set of pre-built classes that can be easily customized or extended to create unique styles.

### Zustand

Zustand is a lightweight state management library for React. Quikkdesign is built with Zustand because it provides a simple and efficient way to manage the state of the editor, such as the current code being edited, the active tab, and the theme.

### Codemirror

Codemirror is a versatile and powerful text editor for the web. Quikkdesign is built with Codemirror because it provides a rich set of features such as syntax highlighting, code autocompletion, and live preview.
